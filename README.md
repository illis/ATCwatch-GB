# ATC Watch w/ Gadgetbridge support.
Modified version of [atc1441's watch firmware](https://github.com/atc1441/ATCwatch).

- Supports Gadgetbridge using bangle.js commands (still can use D6 Notification app w/ build flag}.
  - So far only the following cmds are supported:
    - setTime
    - notify
    - call: incoming (notification only)
- Has internal libs written both zig & rust (wanted to see how well cross compiling worked)
- nix dev shell
- Updated notification's tab

## Setup for your watch
The default settings will:
 - builds a version for a: P22B1  BYM-TUX2-2.0.4
 - accelometer: disabled via ACCL_DISABLE flag
 - heartrate sensor: disabled via HEARTRATE_DISABLE flag
 - D6 Notification app: disabled via D6NOTIFICATION flag

You will need to mod the ./ATCwatch/pinout.h file to suit your specific device.

## Compiling
get into a nix-shell:
```
nix-shell shell.nix
```

run the init (only need to run this once):
```
inv init
```

compile:
```
inv build
```

#### Getting stuck in bootloop after many flashes?
- Might be something to do with the heartrate sensor/lib. Disabling it may help.

# ATCwatch  -WatcH
Custom Arduino C++ firmware for the P8 and PineTime plus many more DaFit Smartwatches

About 150â€“200uA standby current consumtion. Currently 92 Hours Runtime with heavy notification and usage!
Basic menu system and notification working.

If you want to use it on PineTime comment the #define P8WATCH to enable the PineTime Pinout. 
For other watches please try to check the pinout of them and make changes as needed.

**You can support my work via paypal: https://paypal.me/hoverboard1 This keeps projects like this coming.**

Use this portable Arduino version:
- https://atcnetz.de/downloads/D6Arduino.rar

Here is a manual on how to use it:
- https://youtu.be/3gjmEdEDJ5A

Unzip, open Arduino.exe, open the ATCwatch.ino file and compile. Done.
Simply select the DaFit as the board and click on compile. You will get an Update file you can flash in the Arduino folder.

Please make sure you have always an option to go back to Bootloader somehow. I can only suggest to have one watch opened and connected an SWD St-Link V2 to it to develop on that.


**This can be flashed without opening the Watch with this Repo https://github.com/atc1441/DaFlasherFiles and the DaFlasher app from the PlayStore (Android):**

This firmware is meant to be used with the D6Notification App from the PlayStore (Android):

## FAQ / Errors
#### Code does not compile / Arduino puts out errors.
---> This code is meant to be used with the D6Arduino.rar on Windows and is tested that way. Sometimes I make changes to it so you need to update that also when getting the newest firmware. I will try to add information when you need to update it but can not guarantee it, so just try an update if it does not work.

The latest update that needs the newest D6Arduino.rar file is this: https://github.com/atc1441/ATCwatch/commit/0dd3138d10d5c8f1a776ad1b7f1d4819d686e46f
